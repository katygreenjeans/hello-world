# hello-world
Just walking through the tutorial.

Typically, I don't feel like I need to learn how to use GitHub because "there is someone smarter than me that will be able to complete the job faster and more efficiently." 
However, 
I am learning that if I can learn how to use these tools, by trying new things,
that maybe my day can become easier, the story can be translated, and others can join me in my work.
Let's try this!
